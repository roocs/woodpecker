Woodpecker checks and applies known climate-data fixes through a small Python
API, CLI, and recipe system. Use it when a dataset needs a documented repair
before it enters a larger processing workflow.

```

## Quick Start

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate woodpecker
make dev
woodpecker list-recipes
```

Run a discovered recipe:

```python
import woodpecker

recipe = woodpecker.recipe.get("cmip6.core_units")
findings = woodpecker.recipe.check(dataset, recipe)

if findings:
    woodpecker.recipe.fix(dataset, recipe, dry_run=True).preview
    woodpecker.recipe.fix(dataset, recipe, dry_run=False)
```

From the command line:

```bash
woodpecker check ./data --recipe-id cmip6.core_units
woodpecker fix ./data --recipe-id cmip6.core_units --dry-run
```
