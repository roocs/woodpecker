# Overview

Woodpecker is a small adaptation layer for climate-data workflows. It helps you
find known dataset issues, preview the changes, and apply them before the data
moves further through a processing pipeline.

## Core Idea

- A **fix** checks for one known issue and can apply one repair.
- A **recipe** orders one or more fixes into a reusable workflow.
- A **plugin** groups dataset-family fixes and recipes under a stable prefix.
- The **Python API** and **CLI** run the same fix and recipe logic.

## Typical Flow

```mermaid

    Select["Select recipe or fix id"] --> Check["Check dataset"]
    Check --> Findings["Review findings"]
    Findings --> Preview["Dry-run preview"]
    Preview --> Apply["Apply repair"]
```
