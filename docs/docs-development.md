# Docs Development

The documentation site is built with MkDocs Material. It combines hand-written
Markdown pages, generated reference pages, a generated interactive fixes page,
and executed notebooks.

## Setup

Use the project development environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate woodpecker
make dev
```

For docs-only dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[docs]"
```

## Build The Site

Build the generated docs artifacts and run a strict MkDocs build:

```bash
make docs
```

Serve the site locally:

```bash
make docs-serve
```

Both targets regenerate references before running MkDocs.

## Generated Artifacts

These files are generated and should be updated through their scripts:

| Artifact | Generator |
| -------- | --------- |
| `docs/FIXES.md` | `scripts/generate_fix_catalog.py` |
| `docs/FIXES.json` | `scripts/generate_fix_catalog.py` |
| `docs/recipe-reference.md` | `scripts/generate_recipe_catalog.py` |
| `docs/recipe-reference.json` | `scripts/generate_recipe_catalog.py` |
| `docs/fixes.html` | `scripts/generate_fix_webpage.py` |

The interactive fixes page uses the Jinja template at
`scripts/templates/fixes.html.jinja`.

## Notebooks

Notebook examples live in `docs/notebooks/` and are rendered by
`mkdocs-jupyter` during the docs build. The notebooks use deterministic
synthetic datasets so they can run in CI and in local docs builds.

Only `docs/notebooks/*.ipynb` files are processed by `mkdocs-jupyter`. Presentation
tooling in `docs/talks/` and generated files in `docs/_build/` are excluded from
the site. Build presentations separately with `make -C docs/talks`; their Python
scripts must not be executed as notebook cells.

When adding or editing notebooks, prefer examples that exercise the public API
and can run without external climate data files.

## Strict Builds

The docs build runs MkDocs in strict mode:

```bash
NO_MKDOCS_2_WARNING=1 mkdocs build --strict
```

Strict mode treats warnings as failures. This is useful for catching broken
links, missing nav entries, and Markdown pages that do not resolve correctly
inside the `docs/` tree.

## Source Layout

- `mkdocs.yml`: site configuration, theme, plugins, and navigation.
- `docs/index.md`: task-oriented documentation homepage.
- `docs/OVERVIEW.md`: short conceptual overview for the docs site.
- `docs/*.md`: hand-written docs pages and generated references.
- `docs/notebooks/`: executed example notebooks.
- `scripts/`: docs generation scripts.
